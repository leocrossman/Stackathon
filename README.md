# Line Game

* Tensorflow
  * Requirements
    * Data set
      * x and y coords
    - Loss Function
      * Many different loss functions
      * We will use Mean Squared Error
      * Looking to minimize the vertical distance from each point to the line going between them.
        * The sum of all these distances is the number that we want to minimize
    - Optimizer
      * Allows us to _minimize_ the Loss Function
